# Stream-Bot
In production on the Galorants discord server.

A discord bot that detects if someone is streaming, and assigns them a temporary role. "Live", "Streaming Now", etc. The only two things that need to be updated in the code are the role id's on line 46/49, and the bots authentication token. 

You can find discord role ID's by opening up server settings, roles, and then right clicking a role on a discord server!
